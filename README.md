# Pikt
Pikt is a work-in-progress image, pixel-based esoteric programming language that aims at generating fast and lightweight programs from aesthetically pleasant image sources: "keywords" are customizable through a .properties file (run Pikt with the `-createcolors=name` argument to create a scheme).
  
Pikt compiles executables via the Kotlin compiler, therefore compilation for both JVM and native targets is planned.
